Independently Certified by EuroFins to be PFOS/PFOA Free Novacool UEF Summary Brand name: Novacool UEF (Universal Extinguishing Foam). Max Mix Ratio: 0.5% typical Fire Class Application: Class A, Class B, Class D, pressurized and 3-D fires. Application Rate: .2 gpm per sq. ft. Approvals: Manufactured under NFPA 18, UL tested and listed. Shelf life: unlimited Novacool UEF, a fire extinguishing foam, replaces aqueous film-forming foams and ozone depleting halon gases, which release both toxic hydrofluoric acid and fluorocarbons into the environment during use. Novacool UEF provides an innovative, highly effective, and environmentally responsible alternative for firefighters. It is effective at approximately one-seventh the concentration of conventional fire fighting chemicals. Novacool UEF is a mixture of Anionic, Nonionic and Amphoteric surfactants. It does not contain any nonylphenolethoxylates (NPE’s) or glycol ethers. Test data shows it to be readily biodegradable. Novacool UEF works in three ways to extinguish a fire: 1). Reduces the surface tension of water to improve the penetrating ability of water, 2). Vastly improves the heat transfer from the fuel into water, 3). Reduces fuel vapor pressure by emulsifying class B materials at the fuel surface. This is a short explanation of Novacool selective employment of rapidly biodegradable substances, which dramatically enhances the effectiveness of simple water while eliminating the environmental and toxic impact of other traditional fire extinguishment agents. Because Novacool UEF is mixed with water at only 0.5 percent, an 87–93 percent reduction in product use is realized compared to conventional extinguishment agents typically used at 3–6 percent. This unique technology should be deployed at every fire; it was developed in the United States and it is manufactured in the State of New York. List of potential benefits include but is not limited to: When applied as foam through a foaming nozzle or CAFS it can fill voids and stick to a vertical surface. Environmentally responsible formula, rapidly biodegradable. Contains no alcohols (will not cause AFFF to de-foam). Can be mixed with fresh, brackish, or seawater with good foam in all water types. Run off is greatly reduced or eliminated due to the reduced amount of water required to extinguish the fire and the wetting properties that keep the water on and in the fuel. Will coat class A fuels (even waxy vegetation) to increase moisture content. This will provide a barrier to an oncoming flame front. Use concentration 0.4% Class A, 0.5% Class B, typical range is 0.4%. All of our Novacool line of products is fully compatible with all fire fighting apparatus, including the most modern equipment. Fire extinguishing agents and concentrates manufactured by Baum’s Castorine, Inc. are guaranteed to be stable and usable indefinitely. It will not separate out.

Independently Certified by EuroFins to be PFOS/PFOA Free Novacool does an exceptional job on Class A Fires There are foam concentrates formulated specifically for Class A Fires. These concentrates enhance the water stream, making the water more effective by creating a blanket full of bubbles that hold the water in place and allow for the absorption of heat and rapid cooling of the fuels. Class A foam concentrates are tested and used specifically for Class A fuels. Novacool also extinguishes Class A fuels through rapid cooling and water penetration. Novacool is a super-surfactant that outperforms Class A foam by allowing for faster and deeper water penetration. The Kill the Flashover Training Program has made a study of Class A foams and other wetting agents. After rigorous testing, they have concluded that Novacool UEF is the best choice for structure fires without publicly making this acknowledgment to maintain a sense of neutrality. In the event of a Class B fire, Class A fires are often a result. Novacool will take care of both fires at the same time! Kill The Flashover Training Program Explains Enhanced Water Streams (EWS) The Kill the Flashover Training Program began in N. Carolina in 2011 as a response to a line-of-duty death by a Volunteer Fire Department. After much soul searching, the founding members got together and decided it was time to do their own research into best practices for firefighting and to share what they learned through social media and training programs. One of the things that became apparent was that water, while being a good extinguishing agent, became an excellent extinguishing agent by treating that water with a Class A foam concentrate or wetting agent. They were determined to find the best product by doing live fire testing and testing to determine which product allowed for the best penetration into Class A fuels. They collectively decided that Novacool was the best product for enhancing their water. Learn more about Kill the Flashover Landfills Landfills are among the most difficult fires to extinguish due to the deep-seated nature of the fire. Combustibles at the bottom of the pile require the superior penetrating capability of Novacool UEF to allow for the water to soak down to those depths to extinguish the fire. Major excavating is often necessary to churn the pile and mix it in with the enhanced water stream created by using Novacool. Deep Seated Fires Cotton Bails, both the finished product and Cotton motes, are extremely difficult to extinguish. Departments, after flowing thousands of gallons of water and spending an enormous amount of time attempting to extinguish them, often end up burying the piles. Structure Protection Novacool is an excellent tool to use for structure and other exposure protection. This video shows that a homeowner, given enough advance notice of an approaching wildfire, can use a simple garden hose adapted sprayer to spray down one's home to encapsulate it in a "water envelope", providing extra protection. Firefighters routinely use Novacool to spray down adjacent structures and other flammable materials to prevent the further spread of the initial fire. Holding the Line - Wildland Fires A Private Fire Contractor Using Novacool to "hold the line" by spraying down a clump of grasses and weeds shows just how effective Novacool is for pre-treatment of an area to create a fire stop. The contractor, concerned with costs, tested out a variety of Class A foams and wetting agents before settling on Novacool UEF as the best product of the bunch.

Independently Certified by EuroFins to be PFOS/PFOA Free Novacool UEF Extinguishes Class B Fires Including Hydrocarbon and Polar Solvent Fuels Novacool extinguishes these types of fires through rapid cooling without leaving behind the legacy of groundwater and soil contamination that AFFF / AR-AFFF do. Polar Solvent E-85 In this video, both Novacool and 3% AR-AFFF are used to extinguish 1-gallon of E-85 gasoline. Novacool, mixed at just 0.5% extinguished its gallon in just 14 seconds, less than 1/2 the time of the 3% AR-AFFF. Hydrocarbon Fuels 80-Gallons Diesel 2-Gallons Gasoline Novacool vs AR-AFFF This side by side comparison of 0.5% Novacool vs 3% AR-AFFF shows how much faster Novacool is able to extinguish hydrocarbon fuels than AR-AFFF. Customers in the oilfields concure that Novacool outperforms the AFFF/AR-AFFF foam concentrates they used to use before discovering Novacool. Departments are saving water, time, money and lives by using Novacool system-wide for all their firefighting challenges. Jet Fuel This video shows just how easy it is to extinguish jet fuel using Novacool. There is no special technique being used. The firefighters were instructed to "just get the solution on the fire" and use an air aspirating nozzle. As you can see, just as quickly as they apply the Novacool solution, the fire goes out. No rekindles... Novacool vs "Encapsulating Agent" Novacool was tested at 0.5% against another wetting agent mixed at 3%. This particular product claims to be more than a wetting agent, is not a foam, but rather an "encapsulating agent" and that they have never been outperformed. Novacool is also an encapsulating agent. Go here for independent testing confirming Novacool outperforms this particular product. At the end of the day, the St. Louis Fire Dept, after witnessing Novacool vs the Encapsulator Agent extinguish both Class A and Class B fuels, went with Novacool. Novacool vs 3% wetting agent Here Novacool goes against a 3% wetting agent. Again, the wetting agent took over twice as long as Novacool to extinguish this polar solvent. Permian Basin Oil Field Customers All the white dots you see are tank batteries for storing W. Texas Crude Oil. During lightning storms, tank battery fires are a common occurrence. These departments probably fight more Class B fires than anyone in the country. They say they are extinguishing these fires faster than ever before using a fraction of the water and a fraction of the foam concentrate they did in the past. They are also experiencing less maintenance and foam concentrate costs than they did using legacy AFFF / AR-AFFF.

Because these types of fuels cannot be suffocated or deprived of oxygen, legacy, AFFF foams and other wetting agents are not capable of extinguishing them. In independent testing , Novacool was the only 1 of 3 wetting agents that extinguished every fire in the test and was the only one capable of extinguishing the 3D fires. The other wetting agents were mixed at 3% and 6% with Novacool being mixed at 0.5%. It's not the amount of additive that makes the difference. It's the underlying chemistry using premium organic surfactants that allows Novacool to provide rapid cooling and extinguishment. Atomized, unleaded gasoline.

Independently Certified by EuroFins to be PFOS/PFOA Free Novacool and CAFS While our recommendation for applying Novacool solution is to simply use an air aspirating nozzle, many departments are using Novacool with CAFS with great success, both in the public and private sectors. CAFS in the Oilfields Gryphon-Esp provides 24/7 Emergency Site Protection in the oilfields, coast to coast and border to border. They have onsite CAFS and CAFS mounted on All Terrain Vehicles to be able to immediately respond to tank battery and fracking yard fires. Just 42 oz.s of Novacool is used to charge their 60-Gallon CAFS. Their reputation hangs on their ability to quickly extinguish these fires and save their customers huge amounts of money. Playing around with CAFS When this department got their new CAFS, I went down to watch them run Novacool through their system. One can see what an excellent blanket is achieved when using Novacool. The salesman for the CAFS kept remarking about what a great foam blanket was being made and how it was the "best he had seen!" When using CAFS, it is imperative that the amount of air that is introduced doesn't overwhelm the amount of water being used - it is still the water doing the job of rapid cooling and extinguishment.

The new Fire Chief is definitely onboard with the Novacool. Sunland Park, NM - BC Ram Ramiros We are using and absolutely loving NovaCool. Cannot imagine ever using a different product. I still advocate your product in every lecture and training I conduct. Jason from Las Cruces FD We have been Novacool like crazy! We normally run around 100 calls a year, and as of today we are on call 93. So we need to order another pallet of 36 pails please (Chief Ryan Hansen, Yuma, CO) We are still using Novacool, we love it! We have transitioned to Novacool county-wide… (Chief Masterson, Sandoval County) Used some Novacool on a mixed cargo semi fire yesterday. Worked great! The guys used the Novacool on a tank battery fire last night. They used 2 buckets of AR-AFFF and it didn’t touch it. Then they put it out completely with one bucket of Novacool and saved two other tank batteries. Lt. Christopher Dennis I have all my faith in Novacool! (from the Texas oilfields) Chief Hobbs, Andrews, Tx Hi, Casey, It is awesome! We have had a few fires and glad we have it… Casey we have finally had the opportunity to try the Novacool product on a larger scale and found out that it will extinguish class B fires without blanketing the fuel of the fire. We had 10 gal. of diesel fuel,3gal. of gas and six truck tires in a container with the tires standing upright out of the fuel and all fully involved and used 1 13/4 hand line with standard nozzle set at 95gpm and used less than 50 gal.of water and less than a 1/2 gal. of Novacool. The setting for the Novacool was set at 1/2 percent and we had plenty of foam to extinguish the fire. The tires were never submerged in the foam to create a blanket to the fire and take the oxygen away from the tires the way you would have to do with AFFF. I was very pleased in the way the Novacool performed. Asst. Chief Brian Wilson The group that is attending the demonstration is the PFAS advisory group and some legislators. I thought I would invite you to attend since we are using Nova Cool. Nova Cool foam has been great Casey! (Chief Maxon) I hear it all the time: "We LOVE our Novacool!

Independently Certified by EuroFins to be PFOS/PFOA Free Q: Frequently Asked Questions A: What is the Maximum Mix Rate for Novacool UEF? 0.5% for Classes B, D & K 0.4% for Class A Can be used as high as 1% but not recommended B. Can Novacool be mixed at 0.5% for Class A? Yes. Novacool passed the 3A Crib Test for Class Combustibles for knock-down at 0.4% but if your departments set their proportioner at 0.5%, it will work equally as well. Novacool can be used at a mix rate of as little as 0.1% for mop-up and better penetration for duff and landfill fires. We suggest experimenting up and down the dial, never exceeding 1%. Above 1%, Novacool starts to lose its effectiveness. C. What is the shelf life for Novacool? Novacool has an indefinite shelf life in its original, sealed containers. The container can be opened to draw concentrate but then should be immediately sealed. Novacool will not separate over time. D. How long can Novacool be stored in an onboard foam tank? Novacool can be stored in an onboard tank for up to 5 years in the Eastern U.S. where the relative humidity is high and up to 3 years in the West where the relative humidity is much lower. E. What kind of training is necessary with Novacool? Novacool is extremely easy to use. Simply get the solution on the fire, no matter which Class of fire and it will go out. F. Is it necessary to flush out the system after each use? While our customers tell us that lack of maintenance is one of the things they like most about using Novacool, we recommend flushing out the hose line and proportioner after each use. This is particularly important when using a Husky 3 proportioner that is not made from brass instead of stainless steel or bronze and does not have chemical-resistant seals. To date, this is the only proportioner we have run across that has had problems when kept wet instead of dry after each use. G. Is Novacool corrosive? No, it is not corrosive but will rust steel if the steel is left in contact with the solution long enough. Remember, Novacool solution is 99.5% water which will oxidize or rust steel over time. H. Is it okay to leave our handpump immersed in the Novacool concentrate after use? No, we recommend that the pump be removed and the container re-sealed. Metal pick-up tubes will rust and discolor the concentrate and can even make it smell bad. It will not lose its effectiveness. J. Is Novacool effective on lithium batteries? LIthium battery fires are UL classified as Class B fires, which Novacool excels at extinguishing. The electrolyte made up of propylene carbonate ethylene carbonate is what is actually buring and is responsible for the thermal runaway. Novacool will help to cool the fire site and protect the surrounding area from combustion, when used in an outdoor environment. Once the battery is breached and the Novacool solution is applied to the electrolyte, emulsification occurs with the water and electrolyte, isolating the electrolyte within the water which will render it not flammable. As with Class D fires, Novacool should not be used in confined spaces due to the potential for creating an explosive, hydrogen bubble. K. Is Novacool effective in CAFS? Yes, while Novacool is equally effective using an air-aspirating nozzle, it makes a great CAFS foam and is used by many departments in their CAFS. The key to using a CAFS is to make sure there is enough water in the solution, no matter what concentrate is used. If the CAFS is precharged with Novacool and pressurized, it will remain effective for up to one year. After that, it will start to biodegrade and will need to be changed out. For onboard CAFS, the concentrate is stored in a foam tank and this is not an issue. L. What type of Nozzle should be used for Class B, D & K fires? We recommend an air aspirating nozzle. A combination or smooth bore nozzle can also be used but it might be necessary to bank the solution off adjacent walls to agitate the solution, creating a better foam blanket M. What type of Nozzle should be used for Class A fires? In structure fires, we recommend a combination nozzle for closed compartments. A 15-30 degree pattern is best for quickly filling the compartment with the solution for rapid cooling. Solid bore can also be used and is most effective when bouncing the solution off the walls and ceiling. N. Will Novacool extinguish a 3D fire? Yes, independent testing and our testing have both proven that Novacool will extinguish a 3D fire, ie: cascading fuels, pressurized fires and debris falling into the pool of flammable liquids. Novacool will also extinguish running fuel fires. O. Does Novacool meet Mil-Spec requirements? No. Mil-Spec was developed specifically to test AFFF at an application rate of 0.07 gpm per sq. ft. There is very little water used. The water is a delivery system for the poly-saccharides used to create the Aqueous Film Forming Foam. The Mil-Spec testing is done in a highly controlled environment to insure that the blanket is not disrupted. Novacool, on the other hand, is applied at .2 gpm per sq. ft. enhancing the water's inherent extinguishing ability through rapid cooling of the fuels. Novacool has been proven to perform even under adverse weather conditions and 3D scenarios, something AFFF by default cannot do. P. Does Novacool contain PFOS/PFOA's or their 4,000 plus derivatives? No, Novacool does not contain any fluorinated compounds. It is biodegradable and can be used without worrying about contaminating your communities' groundwater or soil. Q. Because Novacool works on 4 Classes of fire, is it more expensive than the alternatives it is being used to replace? No, Novacool is the most cost-effective foam product on the market due to the fact that it used at a maximum mix rate of 0.5% R. Does Novacool extinguish tire fires? Yes, Novacool does an excellent job of extinguishing large tire piles due to its ability to rapidly cool the steel belts that would normally cause the tires to rekindle. Novacool is also able to extinguish the resulting oils released from the tires by the extreme heat. S. Does Novacool extinguish Magnesium Fires? Yes, Novacool, through rapid cooling, is able to extinguish Magnesium Fires but only in unconfined spaces. Like lithium, there is the potential for a hydrogen bubble to occur, which can be explosive in confined spaces. T. Does Novacool make a foam blanket? Yes, once the fire is extinguished, you can build a blanket as deep as you want for vapor suppression. U. Will Novacool freeze? Yes, Novacool will freeze at around 28 degrees F. Once thawed, it will reconstitute back to its original state without separating and will not lose its effectiveness. We have a formula, Novacool Ready To Use Freeze Protected, that is good down to -40 degrees F/C developed for CAFS and pressurized water extinguishers. It is not a concentrate. It is used full strength, ie: a 60-Gallon CAFS will require 12, 5-gallon pails or will fill 2, 2.5-gallon water extinguishers.

Independently Certified by EuroFins to be PFOS/PFOA Free Novacool was formulated and patented by Paul Berger of Baum's Castorine, Rome, New York. Baums had been manufacturing firefighting foam since 1980 for other companies. In the mid 1990's, Berger came up with the formula for Novacool as an answer to the growing problem of fluorinated foams containing PFOS/PFOA's. The handwriting was on the wall when 3M, the major manufacturer of AFFF decided to get out of that business when it was discovered that PFOS was bioaccumulating in the environment in both flora and fauna. Berger was awarded the 1998 Presidential Green Chemistry Award for his work. It has been a classic case of Davie vs Goliath (major AFFF manufacturers) ever since. Due to increased scrutiny, media and legislative attention, Novacool is now coming on strong as a recognized alternative to these so-called "legacy" foams. I am Casey Ryan from Santa Fe, New Mexico. I have spent the past 30 years bringing innovative products to market with the belief that innovation is our only way out of the mess we are creating here on our one and only Planet Earth, Mother to us all. I have been introducing Novacool UEF to the Fire Service since 2011 and love the challenge of introducing a new paradigm in firefighting. You know what they say, Firefighters are resistant to change. I have found that to be true. Resistant, but not totally. I have met some very progressive firefighters willing to take a chance on something new that will make their job safer and easier. After all, the old foams have been found to be bio-accumulative in the environment and very possibly carcinogenic. Plus, they tend to gel over time and gunk up the delivery systems - Not good when you show up to fight a major fire and nothing comes out of the line! Getting going was slow at first. I think firefighters and officers just thought "Oh, another foam salesman!" Luckily, the departments who were open to trying Novacool have become the mainstay of my business as they reorder more and spread the word about how effective - and cost-effective- Novacool is. It is through those 2 things, Repeat Business and Word of Mouth that my business is growing rapidly every year. Whole counties throughout my region are now using Novacool. Why use 2 different products when 1 will take care of all your challenges? And, you can use it in both tanks! That greatly expands your capacity to fight large fires. AND - Check this out: Novacool is used at a maximum mix rate of 0.5%! It can be used as high as 1% but at that rate, you are wasting product I can be reached at: SW Firefighting Foam & Equipment, LLC Casey Ryan 25A Lone Pine Rdg.

Independently Certified by EuroFins to be PFOS/PFOA Free Ethanol & Polar Solvents More Videos Novacool UEF is a specialized fire suppression agent that offers several advantages for ethanol plants. Here are 8 reasons why ethanol plants should consider using Novacool UEF for their fire suppression needs: 1. Enhanced Fire Suppression: Novacool UEF is designed for combating Class B fires, which involve flammable liquids such as ethanol. It has excellent extinguishing properties and can quickly and effectively suppress fires in ethanol plants, minimizing the potential for catastrophic damage. Novacool is equally effective on Class A fires, oftentimes resulting from Class B fires and will provide exposure protection. 2. Novacool extinguishes 3D fires , something no other foam can do, as shown in head-to-head testing against AFFF, AR-AFFF, other wetting agents and the new, 3% fluorine-free foams. 3. Superior Cooling and Heat Resistance: Ethanol fires can reach extremely high temperatures, making it challenging to control them effectively. Novacool UEF has exceptional cooling capabilities and can withstand high heat levels. It is absorbed into the fuel, emulsifying the water and ethanol or other polar solvents, rapidly reducing the temperature and preventing re-ignition. 4. Environmentally Friendly: Novacool UEF is an environmentally conscious choice for fire suppression. It is made from organic surfactants, is biodegradable, non-toxic, and does not contain any hazardous ingredients. It has no environmental impact, reducing concerns about long-term pollution or contamination in case of accidental discharge. 5. Reduced Water Damage: Traditional firefighting methods often involve using large amounts of water to extinguish fires. While water is effective, it can cause significant water damage to equipment and facilities. Novacool UEF requires significantly less water compared to conventional methods, minimizing the potential for water-related damage during fire suppression operations. 6. Novacool UEF, used at a Maximum Mix Rate of 0.5% , is the most cost-effective extinguishing agent for polar solvent fuels . Compared to 3-6% AR-AFFFF, Novacool is used at 1/6th to 1/2th the concentration meaning that the finished foam cost is significantly less. 7. Novacool UEF has an indefinite shelf-life. It will not separate, saving you time on annual inspections and replacement costs in the event you never have a fire. 8. Compatibility and Ease of Use: Novacool UEF is compatible with standard firefighting equipment, including handlines, nozzles, and foam systems. It can be easily integrated into existing fire suppression systems without requiring extensive modifications. Moreover, Novacool UEF is easy to apply and requires minimal training for personnel, simplifying its implementation in ethanol plants.

Which Begs the Question: Why would you continue to buy from any of these companies when Baums Castorine, inventor of Novacool UEF, has always refused to make firefighting foam with fluorosurfactants, understanding basic chemistry and the detrimental, long term effect of these compounds. And has been producing a superior firefighting foam made from organic surfactants that are bio-degradable and pose no long term risk to the planet.
